# QEMU SPECint Performance Plan

This note records the fast SPECint gate shape and the first QEMU profile taken
from that gate. Treat generated profiler output as evidence and this document as
the current optimization plan.

## Fast Gate Shape

Use `tools/bringup/run_specint_fast_gate.py` instead of launching full refrate
or the broad promotion set directly.

- `smoke`: `test-smoke` only, for quick local sanity.
- `pr`: `test-smoke` and `train-smoke`, both using `999.specrand_ir`.
- `nightly`: PR suites plus `test-cpu-stress`, `test-vm-stress`,
  `train-cpu-stress`, `train-vm-stress`, and train promotion breadth.

The gate uses initramfs by default to avoid 9p overhead while debugging QEMU
and Linux correctness. Use `--transports 9p,initramfs` only when transport
coverage is the point of the run.

## Initial Profile

Command shape:

```bash
SPECINT_TRAIN_CPU_STRESS_TIMEOUT=900 \
python3 tools/bringup/run_specint_fast_gate.py \
  --profile nightly \
  --suite train-cpu-stress \
  --qemu emulator/qemu/build-linx/qemu-system-linx64 \
  --append-extra norandmaps \
  --guest-heartbeat-sec 0 \
  --heartbeat-sec 10 \
  --out-dir workloads/generated/specint-qemu-profile-20260627-train-cpu-stress/specint-train-cpu-stress
```

Sampling artifact:

- `workloads/generated/specint-qemu-profile-20260627-train-smoke/qemu-531.sample.txt`

The sampled process was `531.deepsjeng_r` on train input before the gate split
that workload out of `train-smoke`. A follow-up `531.deepsjeng_r` test-input
run also exceeded two minutes before guest-visible completion. The profile
shows the CPU thread spending most visible Linx-specific time under:

- `helper_linx_check_bstart_target`
- `linx_is_bstart_at_addr`
- `cpu_memory_rw_debug`
- `linx_mmu_translate`
- disabled debug/trace helpers, including `linx_dbg_check_mem`
- repeated `getenv`/`__findenv_locked` checks from hot helper paths

The main structural cost is indirect target validation reading guest text via
debug memory access, which then re-enters the Linx MMU walk. The main accidental
cost is disabled diagnostics still present in hot translated code.

## Implemented Low-Risk Fixes

- Cache the `LINX_CFI_TRACE` environment flag before the CFI helper hot path.
- Emit load/store debug watchpoint helpers only for TBs with
  `LINX_TB_FLAG_DBG_ACTIVE`.
- Remove temporary QEMU/kernel diagnostic logging before profiling.

Post-patch sample:

- `workloads/generated/specint-qemu-profile-20260627-train-cpu-stress-postpatch/qemu-531-postpatch.sample.txt`

Top-stack count changes from the initial sample to the post-patch sample:

| Frame | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `__findenv_locked` | 1446 | 0 |
| `getenv` / `DYLD-STUB$$getenv` | 32 | 0 |
| `linx_dbg_check_mem` | 1157 | 0 |
| `helper_linx_dbg_check_load` | 180 | 0 |
| `helper_linx_dbg_check_store` | 66 | 0 |
| `helper_linx_check_bstart_target` | 249 | 130 |
| `linx_is_bstart_at_addr` | 369 | 182 |
| `cpu_memory_rw_debug` | 258 | 196 |
| `linx_mmu_translate` | 1347 | 933 |
| `address_space_translate_internal` | 2310 | 1567 |

The remaining QEMU-specific target is BSTART validation: indirect control-flow
checks still fetch guest text through `cpu_memory_rw_debug`, which repeatedly
enters address-space translation and Linx MMU walking.

## Implemented Target-Read Fix

QEMU commit `7e1981adf5f` replaces the Linx trap/CFI instruction-byte probes
with target-MMU-aware text reads. This removes `cpu_memory_rw_debug` from the
block-boundary recovery path, preserves Linx legacy-MMU fault details for
diagnostics, and keeps user fault/IRQ resume state anchored to a real BSTART
header.

Validation after rebuilding `emulator/qemu/build-linx/qemu-system-linx64`:

- `qemu-system-linx64 --version` reports
  `v10.2.0-943-g7e1981adf5f`.
- `python3 avs/qemu/run_tests.py --all --timeout 20` passes.
- `./avs/qemu/check_system_strict.sh` passes.
- `boot_userspace_proof.py` reaches Linux userspace.
- `run_specint_fast_gate.py --profile smoke` passes on `999.specrand_ir`
  test input.

## Next Speedups

1. Make indirect target validation use the existing `bstart_cache` as a real
   positive cache. The current helper revalidates cache hits, which preserves
   stale-text safety but defeats most of the hot-loop benefit. A practical
   compromise is to invalidate the cache on TLB flush, text store, or explicit
   QEMU TB invalidation, then trust hits.
2. Add a page-local decode cache above the target-aware text read path. The
   current fix avoids debug-memory access but still decodes repeated BSTART
   checks from guest text. Cache decoded BSTART/non-BSTART results by page and
   invalidate them with TB/text invalidation.
3. Split correctness and instrumentation QEMU builds. The default benchmark
   binary should compile without always-on helper instrumentation; a separate
   diagnostics build can keep dense trace hooks and debug checks.
4. Keep 505 memory stress and `531` CPU stress out of cheap PR smoke. They
   should remain isolated as `test-vm-stress`, `train-vm-stress`,
   `test-cpu-stress`, and `train-cpu-stress` so ordinary regressions do not
   spend their budget on the largest allocation/MMU/control-flow workloads
   first.
5. Keep heartbeat and guest logging off for profiler runs. Use
   `--guest-heartbeat-sec 0` and a low or zero host heartbeat unless the guest
   is suspected of hanging.

## Validation Targets

- Rebuild `emulator/qemu/build-linx/qemu-system-linx64`.
- Run `run_specint_fast_gate.py --profile smoke` after each hot-path patch.
- For quick validation, run `train-smoke`; for performance comparisons, sample
  `train-cpu-stress` before and after the patch and compare the
  "Sort by top of stack" section for:
  - `__findenv_locked`
  - `linx_dbg_check_mem`
  - `helper_linx_dbg_check_load`
  - `helper_linx_dbg_check_store`
  - `cpu_memory_rw_debug`
  - `linx_mmu_translate`
