# LinxCore External Interface Contracts

> This published page mirrors the canonical LinxCore source in
> `rtl/LinxCore/docs/architecture/interfaces.md`.


## pyCircuit-LinxCore interface contract (LC-IF-PYC-001)

The pyCircuit/LinxCore integration contract is versioned and gate-enforced.

Contract artifacts:

- `docs/bringup/contracts/pyc_linxcore_interface_contract.json`
- `docs/bringup/contracts/pyc_linxcore_interface_contract.md`

Rules:

- Contract version follows `MAJOR.MINOR`.
- Backward-compatible additions increment `MINOR`.
- Breaking field removals/renames or semantic redefinitions increment `MAJOR`.
- Gate tooling rejects unversioned interface breaks.

## Required commit payload contract (LC-IF-PYC-002)

Required commit fields from `pyc_linxcore_interface_contract.json`:

- `cycle`, `pc`, `insn`
- `wb_valid`, `wb_rd`, `wb_data`
- `mem_valid`, `mem_addr`, `mem_wdata`, `mem_rdata`, `mem_size`
- `trap_valid`, `trap_cause`, `next_pc`

Required environment controls:

- `PYC_COMMIT_TRACE`
- `PYC_BOOT_PC`
- `PYC_MEM_BYTES`
- `PYC_MAX_CYCLES`

## LinxTrace schema contract (LC-IF-TRACE-001)

Trace schema governance:

- canonical contract: `docs/bringup/contracts/trace_schema.md`
- producer-side schema validation: `tools/bringup/validate_trace_schema.py`
- SemVer compatibility gate: `tools/bringup/check_trace_semver_compat.py`

Rules:

- `MAJOR` mismatch is a hard failure.
- `MINOR` must be producer >= consumer expectation.
- Breaking trace changes require major bump and migration checks.

## Trace compatibility contract (LC-IF-TRACE-002)

- `linxtrace.v1` remains stable for additive changes.
- Major-version bump is mandatory for incompatible field/semantics changes.
- Compatibility checks must fail fast on major mismatch.

## Cross-tool synchronization contract (LC-IF-SYNC-001)

The following must stay synchronized when trace/pipeline contracts change:

- `rtl/LinxCore/src/common/stage_tokens.py`
- `rtl/LinxCore/tb/tb_linxcore_top.cpp`
- `rtl/LinxCore/tools/trace/build_linxtrace_view.py`
- `rtl/LinxCore/tools/linxcoresight/lint_linxtrace.py`
- `rtl/LinxCore/tools/linxcoresight/lint_trace_contract_sync.py`

Viewer-side contract sync is validated through LinxTrace gates.

## LinxCoreModel simulator contract (LC-IF-MODEL-001)

`LinxISA/LinxCoreModel` is the current executable reference for the most
accurate Janus Core simulation lane. LinxCore changes that alter
architecture-visible execution, direct-boot workload flow, block/engine
completion, BFU recovery, ELF loading, or MMIO finisher behavior must identify
whether LinxCoreModel already implements the intended behavior.

Required model checkout:

- Repository: `https://github.com/LinxISA/LinxCoreModel.git`
- Branch: `main`
- Current aligned commit: `793722e`

Current build contract from the aligned model:

```bash
cd /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/model/LinxCoreModel
python3 build.py all --target gfsim -j"$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu 2>/dev/null || nproc)"
```

The build helper is the preferred path because it carries the model's current
multi-platform policy:

- CMake minimum is 3.10.
- C++17 requires GCC 8+ or Clang 10+.
- Linux uses the selected system GCC/Clang through `CC` and `CXX`.
- macOS uses Clang and requires Homebrew `libelf`; non-interactive runs may use
  `python3 build.py ... -y` to allow dependency installation.
- `rapidjson` is vendored under `third_party/rapidjson` and should not require
  a host package.

Manual CMake remains legal when the build helper is unsuitable, but it must
preserve the same options and dependency assumptions. Optimized workload
promotion should build `gfsim` with `-DOPT_LEVEL=O3` and
`-DDISABLE_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=ON` when comparing against the AI workload final
target.

## Scope boundary

This document covers **external** LinxCore interface governance only:

- pyCircuit contract
- trace schema contract
- cross-tool synchronization rules
- LinxCoreModel executable-reference build and comparison contract

Detailed LinxCore **microarchitectural** interface contracts (two-layer block machine, BROB-facing resolve,
raw engine fabric, engine/block-type mapping) belong under:

- `rtl/LinxCore/docs/architecture/`
- `docs/architecture/linxcore/microarchitecture.md`

For the current architecture-writing pass, the promoted stage contracts from
`F0` through the baseline issue/wakeup slice (`S1/S2/P1/I1/I2/E1/W1`) are
captured normatively in `docs/architecture/linxcore/microarchitecture.md`,
while this document remains limited to external/tool-facing interface
governance.

## Interface change control

- Interface-visible changes must update contract artifacts first.
- Gate rows in `docs/architecture/linxcore/verification-matrix.md` are the release blocker for interface promotion.
- Any contract-major bump must include migration notes and dual-lane evidence.
- LinxCoreModel-visible behavior changes must record the model commit and the
  exact `gfsim` build/run command used for comparison.
