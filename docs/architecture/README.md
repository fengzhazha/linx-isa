# Architecture Docs

Architecture-facing documentation lives under `docs/architecture/`.

## Canonical contract pages

## ISA manual

- `docs/architecture/isa-manual/`
  - AsciiDoc ISA manual source and generated PDF.

## Governance notes

- LinxArch pages are the canonical architecture contract for bring-up and gates.
- LinxCore contract authoring lives in `rtl/LinxCore/docs/architecture/`; the
  superproject `docs/architecture/linxcore/` pages are generated publication
  mirrors.
- Implementation-specific deep dives in submodules must link back to these
  contract pages.
- Any architecture-affecting change must update LinxArch first, then implementation.
- Archived pre-v0.56 material, pre-canonical draft notes, and research notes are retained for history only and must not be used as the live contract.
- Planning pages may live alongside canonical pages when they define the staged path to the next contract freeze; they must state clearly whether they are normative.
